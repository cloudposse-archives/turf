# Short description of this project
description: |-
  Command line utility for creating GitHub comments on Commits, Pull Request Reviews, Pull Request Files, Issues and Pull Requests.

  GitHub API supports these types of comments:

  * [Comments on Repos/Commits](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/comments)
  * [Comments on Pull Request Reviews](https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/reviews/#create-a-pull-request-review)
  * [Comments on Pull Request Files](https://developer.github.com/v3/pulls/comments)
  * [Comments on Issues](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/comments)
  * [Comments on Pull Requests (in the global section)](https://developer.github.com/v3/issues/comments)

  Since GitHub considers Pull Requests as Issues, `Comments on Issues` and `Comments on Pull Requests` use the same API.

  The utility supports all these types of comments (`commit`, `pr-review`, `pr-file`, `issue`, `pr`).

  The utility can be called directly or as a Docker container.

  ### Build the Go program locally

  ```sh
  go get

  CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -v -o "./dist/bin/posse-cli" *.go
  ```


  ### Run locally

  ```sh
  ./dist/bin/posse-cli
  ```


  ### Run locally with command-line arguments
  [run_locally_with_command_line_args.sh](examples/run_locally_with_command_line_args.sh)

  ```sh
  ./dist/bin/posse-cli \
          aws \
          hub set-administrator-account \
          -administrator-account-role arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/acme-gbl-security-admin \

          --region us-west-2
  ```

  ### Build the Docker image

  ```sh
  docker build --tag posse-cli  --no-cache=true .
  ```

  ### Run with Docker
  Run `posse-cli` in a Docker container with local ENV vars propagated into the container's environment.
  [run_docker_with_local_env_vars.sh](examples/run_docker_with_local_env_vars.sh)

  ```sh
  docker run -i --rm \
          posse-cli
