## Usage

```sh
posse --help for help
```

The utility can be called directly or as a Docker container.

### Build the Go program locally

```sh
go get

CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -v -o "./dist/bin/posse" *.go
```

### Build the Docker image

**NOTE**: it will download all `Go` dependencies and then build the program inside the container (see [`Dockerfile`](Dockerfile))

```sh
docker build --tag turf  --no-cache=true .
```

### Run with Docker

Run `turf` in a Docker container with local ENV vars propagated into the container's environment.
[run_docker_with_local_env_vars.sh](examples/run_docker_with_local_env_vars.sh)

```sh
docker run -i --rm \
  turf
```

## Examples

### Delete all the VPCs in an AWS Account

Best-practices call for not using the default VPC, but rather, creating a new set of VPCs as necessary. AWS Security
Hub will flag the default VPCs as non-compliant if they aren't configured with best-practices. Rather than jumping
through hoops, it's easier to delete to default VPCs. This task cannot be accomplished with terraform, so this command
is necessary.

```sh
posse aws \
  delete-default-vpcs \
  --role arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/acme-gbl-root-admin \
  --delete
```

### Deploy Security Hub to AWS Organization

The AWS Security Hub administrator account manages Security Hub membership for an organization. The organization
management account designates the Security Hub administrator account for the organization. The organization management
account can designate any account in the organization, including itself.

```sh
posse aws \
  securityhub \
  set-administrator-account \
  --administrator-account-role arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/acme-gbl-security-admin \
  --root-role arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/acme-gbl-root-admin \
  --region us-west-2
```

### Disable Security Hub Controls

DisableSecurityHubGlobalResourceControls disables Security Hub controls related to Global Resources in regions that
aren't collecting Global Resources. It also disables CloudTrail related controls in accounts that aren't the central
CloudTrail account.

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-cis-to-disable.html
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/securityhub-standards-fsbp-to-disable.html

```sh
posse aws \
  securityhub \
  disable-global-controls \
  --role arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/acme-gbl-security-admin \
  --global-collector-region us-west-2
```

```sh
posse aws \
  securityhub \
  disable-global-controls \
  --role arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/acme-gbl-audit-admin \
  --global-collector-region us-west-2 \
  --cloud-trail-account
```

### Deploy GuardDuty to AWS Organization

When you use GuardDuty with an AWS Organizations organization, you can designate any account within the organization
to be the GuardDuty delegated administrator. Only the organization management account can designate GuardDuty
delegated administrators.

```sh
posse aws \
  guardduty \
  set-administrator-account \
  -administrator-account-role arn:aws:iam::111111111111:role/acme-gbl-security-admin \
  -root-role arn:aws:iam::222222222222:role/acme-gbl-root-admin \
  --region us-west-2
```
